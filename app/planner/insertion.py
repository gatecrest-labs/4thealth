"""
First-match insertion analysis.

Given the ordered policies of a package and a candidate new rule, compute
where the rule must sit so it actually takes effect: before the first
existing policy that would otherwise match the same traffic. Also reports
which earlier policies would fully shadow the candidate and which later
policies the candidate would fully shadow.
