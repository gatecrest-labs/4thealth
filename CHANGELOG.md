## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Device Review — Interface Protocols:** Interfaces with only informational protocols (ping, fgfm, capwap, etc.) now report `INFO` instead of `WARN`. The `WARN` result is effectively unused for Interface Protocols — unknown protocols default to `None` (informational), making WARN unreachable in practice.
- **Device Review — CIS Host Checks (NTP, Syslog, FortiAnalyzer, DNS):** Checks that compare expected server addresses now return `WARN` (amber) when the service is active but servers do not match, instead of `FAIL`. `FAIL` is reserved for when the service is disabled or completely unconfigured. IP addresses and FQDNs are both handled via DNS resolution.
- **Admin tab renamed** — "Config-Diff" sub-tab renamed to "Scheduled" to reflect its role as the home for all recurring audit and report jobs.
- **Config-Diff scheduled jobs** — day-of-week selector replaced with a multi-checkbox day picker; jobs now store `days_of_week` (array) instead of `day_of_week` (string), allowing any combination of 1–7 days per job (e.g. Mon + Thu only). Job form panel dark mode rendering fixed by replacing hard-coded inline hex colours with CSS custom properties.
- **Zone Policy — Edit Database moved to Admin:** The Edit Database sub-tab has moved from the Zone Policy page to **Admin → Zone Policy**. All edit functionality (zone/subnet/policy-rule CRUD, policy_db.json backup) is identical. Only admins could ever access it; moving it to the Admin tab removes the absent-tab confusion for non-admin users.

### Added
- **Admin — Host resource graphs:** Three line charts (CPU %, Memory %, Disk %) appear above the Admin tab bar on every Admin page. A time-range selector (1H / 4H / 12H / 1D / 7D / 14D, default 1H) adjusts the visible window; charts auto-refresh every 60 seconds. Usage data is sampled via `psutil` every 60 seconds and retained in SQLite (`host_metrics.db`, project root, gitignored) for 90 days. In Docker environments, the Memory card shows an ⓘ tooltip noting that the value reflects host memory — the container memory limit may differ.
- **Backup — SCP transfer protocol:** Admin → Backup → Remote Transfer now supports SCP in addition to SFTP and FTP. SCP uses SSH (port 22 by default) and shares the same host/port/username/password configuration fields as SFTP.
- **Backup tab** — New **Admin → Backup** sub-tab for creating and scheduling encrypted configuration backups. One-time backups are saved to the server and downloaded directly to the admin's browser. Scheduled backups (daily/weekly/custom) use APScheduler CronTriggers and optionally transfer archives to a remote FTP or SFTP server. All archives are AES-256 encrypted ZIPs (`pyzipper`) named `SERVERNAME-BACKUP_YYYY-MM-DD_HHmm.zip`. The last 20 local archives are retained automatically; older ones are pruned. The backup password is shown once on first save (same UX as API tokens) and never again — store it offline. Replaces the manual shell-script workflow previously documented in `docs/backup.md`, which is now a restore-only runbook.
- **Firewalls tab — Export device list:** The Firewalls tab device list can now be exported as CSV, JSON, or PDF. Three export buttons appear in the device table toolbar after an ADOM is selected. Exports reflect the current search filter and include: Name, Comment, Management IP, Platform, Version, Serial, and HA Mode (standalone or cluster mode string). PDF opens as a styled HTML page in a new tab for print-to-PDF.
- **Object Lookup — Where Used:** Each object lookup result now has a **Where Used** button that opens a modal showing every address/service group that contains the object, and every policy rule across all packages in the ADOM that references it — directly by name or indirectly through a group. The modal's *Via* column identifies direct references vs. the specific group name for indirect ones.
- **Device Review — Protocol Severity Config:** Create `protocol_severity.json` at the project root to override default protocol classifications (secure/insecure/info) without code changes. See `protocol_severity.example.json` for all defaults. Changes take effect on app restart.
- **Device Review Scheduled Reports — Host Summary:** Scheduled email reports now include a per-host summary table (Device | PASS | FAIL | INSECURE | WARN | CONFIG_MISSING | INFO | Total) in both the email body and the attached report (HTML, CSV, and JSON formats).
- **Config-Delta navigation guard** — a `beforeunload` browser confirmation dialog now fires if the user tries to navigate away or close the tab while a bulk export is in progress.
- **Scheduled Config-Delta exports** — admin users can create weekly scheduled jobs (ADOM, day, time, format, email recipient) that run server-side and email the full diff report as an attachment with an HTML summary in the body.
- **Admin → Scheduled sub-tab** — new admin panel (renamed from Config-Diff) for managing SMTP settings (host, port, TLS, optional auth) with a test-send button, Config-Delta scheduled-jobs table, and Device Review scheduled-jobs table. Each table has add/edit/delete/run-now controls and per-job run history (30-day retention by default).
- **Device Review Scheduled Jobs** — admins can create recurring CIS hardening audit jobs: choose an ADOM, select any subset of the 18 checks, supply per-check parameters (e.g. expected NTP/syslog IPs, min firmware version), set a day-of-week + time schedule, and email results as PDF, CSV, or JSON. Jobs are persisted in `device_review_jobs.json` and registered as APScheduler CronTriggers at startup.

### Fixed
- **Zone policy `"allow only"` verdicts** — `evaluate()` in `app/zone_db.py` ignored the service restriction on `"allow only"` policies: a requested service that didn't match the policy's `services` list fell through to the default `ALLOWED` return, behaving identically to `"allow all"`. Non-matching services for a governed zone pair now correctly resolve to `BLOCKED` (affects `/api/zone/query` and `/external/api/zone/query`). `"allow all"`, `"block all"`, and `"block only"` behavior is unchanged.
- **Device Review scheduled email reports** — protocol names (PING, HTTPS, SSH, HTTP, Telnet, etc.) were missing from the Detail column for Interface Protocols findings. The HTML, CSV, and PDF attachment builders now fall back to the `protocols` list when `detail` is empty, showing e.g. `ping, https (insecure), ssh`.

## [2026-07-23] — Config-Delta rename and bulk ADOM export

### Changed
- DIFF (BETA) tab renamed to **Config-Delta** across the nav bar, page title, heading, and export filenames. Internal tab key (`pending_changes`), URL (`/pending-changes`), and all API paths are unchanged — no permission migration required.

### Added
- **Export All Devices** control on the Config-Delta tab: a format selector (CSV / JSON / PDF) paired with an **Export All** button. Clicking the button sequentially fetches the pending diff for every device in the selected ADOM, shows a live progress indicator (`Fetching N of M — <device>…`), and downloads a single combined file when complete.
  - Devices with no pending changes are included in the export with a `no_changes` status rather than being silently omitted.
  - Devices that error during preview are included with their error message; the run continues to the next device.
  - A **× Cancel** link aborts the run mid-flight with no partial download.
  - The existing per-device export queue is unaffected and works alongside the new bulk export.

---

## [2026-07-17] — DIFF tab performance (Option D)

### Added
- `app/pending_status_cache.py` — background APScheduler job (30-minute interval) that pre-fetches device list + `pkg_status` for every ADOM. The DIFF tab device table now loads from this cache (sub-50 ms) instead of blocking on N parallel FMG API calls (previously 5–15 s on large ADOMs). Falls back to a live FMG fetch on cold start before the first cache cycle completes.
- Async task+poll pattern for per-device diff preview: `POST /api/pending-changes/adoms/<adom>/device/<device>/preview` now returns `{"task_id": "<uuid>"}` immediately instead of blocking. `GET /api/pending-changes/task/<task_id>` returns `{status, step, result, error}`. Task entries are evicted after 10 minutes.
- Step-label spinner in the DIFF panel: the browser polls every 2 s and shows the current step label ("Fetching device info…", "Staging policy package…", "Parsing diff…") so operators can see forward progress during the 15–60 s FMG chain instead of a silent spinner.

### Changed
- `pending_changes_routes.py`: devices endpoint reads from `pending_status_cache`; preview endpoint spawns a daemon thread and returns a task ID; new poll endpoint added.
- `pending_changes.js`: `loadPreview()` replaced with a two-step fetch (POST → task_id, then `setTimeout` poll loop); `showDiffSpinner()` now accepts and displays a step-label argument.

## [2026-07-15] — DIFF (Beta) fix for FortiManager 7.6.x

### Fixed
- `get_package_info()` didn't recognize FMG 7.6.x's `"conflict"` package status (previously only `"modified"`/`"installed"` were handled), so a device with a modified-but-conflicted package was treated as unassigned and its package was never staged for preview — the DIFF tab reported "No pending changes found" even when a real diff existed.
- `get_install_preview()` now links the staged package's task ID through to `install/preview` and `preview/result` via `preview_taskid`. FMG 7.6.7 requires this linkage to return diff content; without it, `install/preview` reports `status=OK` but `preview/result` always returns `"=== No preview result ==="` for the device.
- The result lookup tries the previously-working key first (the `install/preview` call's own task ID, confirmed against FMG 7.4.10 in production) and only falls back to the stage task's ID when that returns no diff, so 7.4.x behavior is unchanged.

---

## [2026-07-15] — DIFF (Beta) tab polish

### Changed
- Device table now shows a single compact badge per row (highest-priority state: Out of Sync → Pending → Pkg Pending → In Sync) so rows remain single-line at all viewport widths.
- Diff panel header reorganised: device name + IP + badges on one line; export button and help icon pushed right with `margin-left:auto`.
- CLI legend moved into the `?` tooltip — removes noisy inline text from the diff panel.
- VDOM section headers reduced in visual weight (uppercase muted small-caps) so CLI diff content has more visual prominence.

---

## [2026-07-15] — DIFF (Beta) performance

### Fixed
- `pkg_status` lookups now execute in parallel (10-worker `ThreadPoolExecutor`) so the device-list endpoint no longer times out (HTTP 504) on large ADOMs.

---

## [2026-07-15] — DIFF (Beta) bug fixes

### Fixed
- Staging an already-installed package clears the install-preview result; the route now only stages packages whose status is `modified`.
- `_package/status` field names corrected; multi-VDOM package staging now iterates all VDOMs.
- Install/package step is skipped entirely when no package name can be resolved for the device.
- Package name is passed correctly to `install/package` to resolve "Invalid package oid/name" errors from FMG.
- Devices that are in-sync with FMG are now handled gracefully instead of producing an error; raw FMG error text is surfaced in the UI for out-of-sync or unreachable devices.
- Install preview repaired for FMG 7.4.4+ by chaining trigger + task-poll workflow before reading diff output.

---

## [2026-07-14] — DIFF (Beta) tab — initial release

### Added
- **DIFF (Beta)** tab (`/pending-changes`) — per-device install-pending diff viewer.
  - Two-column layout: ADOM selector + device table on the left, diff panel on the right.
  - Device table shows `conf_status`, `db_status`, and `pkg_status` per device; full-text search and **Pending only** filter.
  - Diff panel renders colour-coded per-VDOM CLI diffs (`+` green additions, `-` red deletions, `~` amber modifications) with category summary tiles.
  - Export queue — stage multiple devices, then export as **CSV**, **JSON**, or **PDF** (each export includes ADOM, device list, timestamp, and username).
  - AbortController cancels in-flight preview requests when the user clicks a different device.
  - XSS-safe rendering via `esc()` helper on all interpolated values.
- `GET /api/pending-changes/adoms` — ADOM list (forti-prefix filtered, ADOM-access filtered).
- `GET /api/pending-changes/adoms/<adom>/devices` — device list with sync-status fields.
- `POST /api/pending-changes/adoms/<adom>/device/<device>/preview` — trigger + return parsed CLI diff.
- `parse_preview_diff()` in `app/fmg_client.py` — chains FMG trigger + task-poll and parses raw CLI text into structured `{type, line}` objects grouped by VDOM.
- `get_devices_with_sync_status()` and `get_install_preview()` added to `FMGClient`.
- `tests/test_pending_changes.py` — unit tests for parser and route behaviour.

---

## [2026-07] — CIS Hardening checks (Device Review)

### Added
- 15 CIS Level 1/2 hardening checks added to the Device Review tab (NTP, Syslog, Trusted Hosts, Default Admin, Idle Timeout, Lockout Threshold, Password Length, Disk Logging, Log Severity, FortiAnalyzer Logging, DNS Servers, SNMP Version, SNMP Read-Only, TLS Version, SSH Ciphers, Firmware Version, HA Sync).
- Parameterised checks display a **Check Parameters** panel before the run — operators enter expected IPs, timeouts, and thresholds without redeploying.
- Result values expanded: `PASS`, `FAIL`, `CONFIG_MISSING`, `INSECURE`, `WARN`, `INFO`.
- `device_data` dict pattern — only data blobs required by selected checks are fetched per device.

### Changed
- Device Review check registry (`CHECKS` list in `app/device_review.py`) generalised to support `data_keys` and `params_schema` — adding a new binary check requires no template or frontend changes.

---

## [2026-07] — Global policy block inlining (Rule Review)

### Added
- Global policy block rules (header and footer sections) are inlined into the Policy Rules viewer alongside local package rules.

### Fixed
- Policy package lookup no longer blocks the SSE `done` event.
- Per-package API calls eliminated from policy package lookup (single bulk call).

---

## [2026-07] — Security hardening

### Fixed
- XSS in `onclick` handlers and CSV quoting in the pending-changes frontend.
- CSRF token injection broken by explicit empty header — resolved.
- Open-redirect protection enforced on login `?next=` parameter.

---

## [2026-06] — SNMPv3 infrastructure polling

### Added
- Background SNMPv3 poller (`app/infra_health_cache.py`) for FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer, and FortiAuthenticator CPU/memory — replaces JSON-RPC polling for those device types.
- Per-device SNMP credential overrides in `infra_targets.json` (`snmp_user`, `snmp_auth_key`, `snmp_priv_key`, `snmp_auth_protocol`, `snmp_priv_protocol`).
